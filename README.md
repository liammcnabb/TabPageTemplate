# TabPageTemplate
A tab page I made for myself to use. Basic and a bit messy in terms of code but gets the job done.

Change the links by looking for the links-container. In there will be 5 sections, with 4 links each in the template. You can use as many as you like, however there might be some overflow. Also remember to increase the width of the #links (line 70 default) to allow more room for the new sections
